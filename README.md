This page is dedicated to the distribution of the data used for the paper: "BrokenStrokes: On the (in)Security of Wireless Keyboards", by Gabriele Oligeri, Savio Sciancalepore, Simone Raponi, and Roberto Di Pietro, accepted and presented at the 2020 ACM Conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks.

In our paper, these data have been used to identify if a user is typing a pre-defined keyword, such as "password", and to find that "keyword" in a complex sentence.

For the data acquisition, we adopted a commercial laptop (Dell XPS 15 9560), featuring a Linux distribution and GNU Radio (a free and open-source software development toolkit), a commercial Software-Defined Radio, and either an omnidirectional (VERT2450) or a directional antenna (Aaronia HyperLOG 60350), depending on the considered attack scenarios. 

Within each file, there are 2 columns, whose meaning is according to the following description:

col.1: unix timestamp related to the detection of the wireless signal by the radio
col.2: Received Signal Strength (RSS)
